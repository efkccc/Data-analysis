# Data-analysis
Data-analysis is a project in Rstudio for Chudi's thesis (title: Metacognition in Distinct Perceptual Tasks.), supervised by Matan Mazor and Dr. Steve Fleming.

The thesis that included the scripts for data analysis was written in Rmarkdown, and can be fully reproduced by clonning this repo. 

## Usage
To reproduce, make sure installing TinyTex as recommended here https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html if you do not have LaTex installed before.

```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```
