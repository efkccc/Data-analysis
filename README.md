# Data-analysis
Data-analysis is a project in Rstudio for Chudi's thesis (title: Metacognition in Distinct Perceptual Tasks.), supervised by Matan Mazor and Dr. Steve Fleming.

This repo included the .rmd file for rendering the thesis, the graphics (.png files) used in thesis and the experimental data (two .csv files) from an incomplete sample of 25 participants.
